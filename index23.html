        Crush, Supermarket, California
        By Jan-Henry Gray

        <br>
        <br>It's easy to
        <br>fall in love
        <br>with the
        <br>grocery store boysâ€”
        <br> the one with the
        <br>tiny coffee cup
        <br>sweatshirt, too-tight
        <br>pants & cotton shoes or
        <br>the impossibly pale
        <br>fish boy who smiles
        when he says, I'm
        from Alaska. Your
        heart swelled,
        stupid &
        dreaming
        of a boat
        in arctic
        waters,
        stars,
        dots
        that 
        dot the
        ocean floor, you
        will read
        him poems & he
        will explain the code
        in the constellation
        until morning,
        <br>waking together,
        <br>hunting for
        <br>no fish, sailing
        <br>as you two do,
        <br>parallel
        <br>only to
        <br>each other,
        <br>listening to ice
        <br>melt
        <br>back
        <br>to water.

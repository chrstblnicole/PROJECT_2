  Crush, Supermarket, California

  It's <br>easy <br>to
  <br>fall <br>in <br>love
  <br>with <br>the
  <br>grocery <br>store <br>boysâ€”
  <br>the one<br> with <br>the
  tiny coffee cup
  sweatshirt, <br>too-tight
  pants & <br> cotton shoes or
  the impossibly pale
  fish <br>boy who smiles
  when he says,<i>I'm
  from Alaska.</i> <br>Your
  heart swelled,
  <br>stupid <br>&
  <br>dreaming
  of a <br>boat
  <br>in arctic
  <br>waters,
  <br>stars,
  <br>dots
  <br>that 
  <br>dot <br>the
  ocean floor, <br>you
  will read
  <br>him poems & <br>he
  will explain <br>the code
  in the constellation
  <br>until morning,
  <br>waking together,
  <br>hunting for
  no fish, <br>sailing
  as you two do,
  parallel
  <br>only to
  each other,
  <br>listening to ice
  melt
  <br>back
  to water.
